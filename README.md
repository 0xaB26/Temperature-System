4-Digit Temperature Display is a microcontroller-based project that measures and displays temperature data using an LM35 temperature sensor. 
The system employs a PIC18F452 microcontroller to read the analog temperature data via its ADC and processes this data to be shown on a 4-digit 7-segment display. 
The MAX7221 IC is used to control the 7-segment display, which is interfaced using the SPI protocol. 
The system can accurately measure temperatures ranging from 0°C to 150°C and presents the temperature in a clear, easily readable format on the 4-digit display.
